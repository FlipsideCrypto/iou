# Cross-Chain IOUs 

Powering the functionality of trusted cross-chain payments, IOUs stand as an on-chain representation for an asset owed. Offered by the token distributor, a signature is enforced to provide an opportunity that all tokens minted have funds to be redeemed against.

> This system utilizes a trusted party to provide the IOU, and is not a decentralized solution.
